      "description": "What is Data Visualization?\n\nData is an increasingly potent tool at the negotiating table. The expectations have moved beyond manipulating headline figures to detailed correlation analysis. Travel managers and buyers are looking at data on total spend, compliance with policy and preferred booking channels, missed savings, advance booking windows, and online adoption across several dimensions.\n\nItâ€™s time for an overhaul of the phrase, a picture is worth a thousand words, because todayâ€™s travel manager will tell you that data visualization is worth millions of dollars.\n\nEgencia Business Travel Academy\nLearn the basics of Business Travel with Egencia.\n\nWe travel on business for all sorts of reasons: to close the deal, to meet the team or to meet the customer. Sometimes, it means a suite with a fantastic view, more often it doesn't. In the end, no matter where you're going, whether it's exotic or ordinary, business travel is work. And it's our job to make it easier for you. We do that by making it faster through our innovative technology. Whether you're arranging travel for others; or overseeing budgets, policy, compliance and traveler safety. And above all else, we strive to give travelers solutions that solve their problems, surprise them with efficiency and delight them in experience. As the line between our business and personal lives blur, shouldn't we demand the same innovation we see in our homes, at our workplace? Shouldn't your travel partner ask every day if it's possible there, why not here? As part of Expedia Group, the world's largest online travel company, Egencia has the most relevant inventory for your business travel needs. We combine this with first class customer service. We are here when your travelers need us the most. At Egencia, our promise to you is simple. It is all about you and always will be. \n\nCheck us out on http://www.egencia.com and get in touch.",

      "description": "Today we're going to start our two-part unit on data visualization. Up to this point we've discussed raw data - which are just numbers - but usually it's much more useful to represent this information with charts and graphs. There are two types of data we encounter, categorical and quantitative data, and they likewise require different types of visualizations. Today we'll focus on bar charts, pie charts, pictographs, and histograms and show you what they can and cannot tell us about their underlying data as well as some of the ways they can be misused to misinform.  \n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

Support your local PBS Member Station here: http://to.pbs.org/Donateoffbook\n\nHumans have a powerful capacity to process visual information, skills that date far back in our evolutionary lineage. And since the advent of science, we have employed intricate visual strategies to communicate data, often utilizing design principles that draw on these basic cognitive skills. In a modern world where we have far more data than we can process, the practice of data visualization has gained even more importance. From scientific visualization to pop infographics, designers are increasingly tasked with incorporating data into the media experience. Data has emerged as such a critical part of modern life that it has entered into the realm of art, where data-driven visual experiences challenge viewers to find personal meaning from a sea of information, a task that is increasingly present in every aspect of our information-infused lives. \n\nFeaturing:\nEdward Tufte, Yale University\nJulie Steele, O'Reilly Media\nJosh Smith, Hyperakt\nJer Thorp, Office for Creative Research\n\nOffice of Creative Research:\n\"Gate Change\" by Ben Rubin w/ Mark Hansen & Jer Thorp\n\"And That's The Way It Is\" by Ben Rubin w/ Mark Hansen & Jer Thorp\n\"Shakespeare Machine\" by Ben Rubin w/ Mark Hansen & Jer Thorp\n\"Moveable Type\" by Ben Rubin & Mark Hansen\n\"Listening Post\" by Ben Rubin & Mark Hansen\n\nSources:\nFacebook World Map - Produced by Facebook intern, Paul Butler.  http://gigaom.com/2010/12/14/facebook-draws-a-map-of-the-connected-world/\nParis Subway Activity - Eric Fisher - http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/\nRich Blocks, Poor Blocks - http://www.richblockspoorblocks.com/\n\"Hurricanes since 1851\" - by John Nelson, http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/\n\"Flight Patterns\" by Aaron Koblin - http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work/flightpatterns/\n\"We Feel Fine Project\" by Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar -  http://wefeelfine.org/\n\"Every McDonald's in the US\" by Stephen Von Worley - http://www.datapointed.net/2009/09/distance-to-nearest-mcdonalds/ \n\"Colours in Culture\" by informationisbeautiful.net - http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/colours-in-cultures/\n\nMusic:\n\"The Blue Cathedral\" by Talvihorros - http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Talvihorros/Bad_Panda_45/The_Blue_Cathedral\n\"Sad Cyclops\" by Podington Bear - http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Podington_Bear/Ambient/SadCyclops\n\"Between Stations\" by Rescue - http://archive.org/details/one026\n\"Tomie's Bubbles\" by Candlegravity\n\"Earth Breath\" by Human Terminal - http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Human_Terminal/Press_Any_Key/01_Earth_Breath\n\"Unreal (Album Version)\" by Garmisch - http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Garmisch/Glimmer/02_-_Unreal_Album_Version\n\nMore Off Book:\n\nThe Future of Wearable Technology\nhttp://youtu.be/4qFW4zwXzLs\n\nIs Photoshop Remixing the World?\nhttp://youtu.be/egnB3teYiPQ\n\nCan Hackers be Heroes? \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVtrA7juc-w\n\nThe Rise of Webcomics \nhttp://youtu.be/6redB3Xev14\n\nWill 3D Printing Change The World? \nhttp://youtu.be/X5AZzOw7FwA\n\n\nFollow Off Book:\nTwitter: @pbsoffbook\nTumblr: http://pbsarts.tumblr.com/\n\nProduced by Kornhaber Brown: http://www.kornhaberbrown.com",
